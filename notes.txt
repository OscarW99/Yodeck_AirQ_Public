Prompt:
I need your help creating a project. Here is the project brief from the client.

Project Brief:
"""
As discussed, I have a number of digital signage screens on construction sites, and want to install an ‘M5 AirQ’ air quality device to display some of the resulting air quality info on the screen.

The AirQ automatically publishes air quality data to a webpage for example. https://airq.m5stack.com/24587C53B584 - (NB. I own the device associated with this URL)

Yodeck provide a custom widget user guide https://www.yodeck.com/docs/user-manual/build-an-html-widget/ and their tutorial says: "Anyone who can develop an HTML5/Javascript web page can develop an App. No special skills are required."

Additional info:

- I would like to show the following info from the AirQ webpage:
From SEN55 Sensor; Humidity, PM1.0, PM2.5, PM4.0, PM10, VOC & NOx (both without the 'need long time measure' note); and From SCD40 Sensor the CO2 reading.

-There is a 'Raw Data' link at the bottom of the AirQ page that corresponds to the same information in a basic text format, and it might be easier to use that as a source of info for building an HTML app
"""

To start with lets just set up the Project directory. We need a HTMl static website. I think using something like tailwind css for styling would be good. I have activated the conda env I will be working in.

Concerns:
- Need to be able to handle different URLs. So there may be different air quality for different rooms in the future, so I want this designed in a way that will allow for this.
- For the dash board (index.html, it would also be good If the clinet has some control from here. E.g. the ability to set light or dark mode for the individual pages. Also maybe there could even be a overview of the values for each page - like little cards for each. This index.html file should be designed to be clickable and usable by the client whilst the others are merely static web pages for display on yodeck screen.)

- A way to handle missing data or broken link that will be ok in production env
- Check gitignore is working properly as files are not dimmed.
- Can you make sure the room template is still representitive of the room1 html file we have.
- The lightmode/ darkmode switch doesnt work
- Is there a way to email kane when a room hs been offline for 5 minutes? - is there a way to show stale status when not upated in over 1 minutes.
- Shall we remove the Refresh option and just have default 30seconds.
- How are we measureing is domething is online
Can we have a single refresh for all rooms on the index page
Lets rmove the refresh option - it should be default 3o seconds but you can do it manually as well.
Lat update should have data as well as time
- Ability to change name of room on index page: should propegate to main page.

Questions for Client:
Do you want me to show what average values look like as values alone may not mean anything to the average person
