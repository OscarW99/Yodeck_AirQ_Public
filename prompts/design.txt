Ok cool. Lets keep the templates folder. 
The idea is that I will be able to embed the individual html files on yodeck. So actually I'm not sure if having the 'back to dashboard' link on the page is a good idea as its not relevant when for example displaying a scrren on site which just needs the airqaulity info. That being said, I do think the index page is still good to have more so for reference and quick look up of what is goin gone. But as this will not be used as a clickable site and more a static web page displayed, then I think we should have the back link visible - maybe we can make it hidden in the design somewhere?
On this not, the design is not currently very good. I want you to take the following design prompt that I create using claude and try to create the style:
Claude Design Prompt: 

"""
Create a modern, sleek design for a digital signage widget that will display key air quality metrics on construction sites. The focus is entirely on the look, style, and layout of the widget, ensuring that the numbers and information are clear and easily readable, even when the widget is scaled down as part of a larger Yodeck layout.
Design Requirements:
Visual Hierarchy & Emphasis:
Prioritize large, bold typography for the numerical values so that they are the primary focal point.
Use clear, minimalist labeling for each metric (e.g., Humidity, PM1.0, PM2.5, PM4.0, PM10, VOC, NOx, CO2).
Layout:
Design a responsive layout that adapts to different sizes, as the widget may be integrated within a larger screen.
Consider a grid or flexbox layout that organizes the data neatly, ensuring balance and clarity.
Aesthetic Style:
Aim for a modern and sleek appearance with a minimalist design.
Use a clean color palette with high contrast (e.g., a light background with dark text or vice versa) to ensure readability in various lighting conditions on construction sites.
Incorporate subtle shadows, gradients, or borders to add depth without distracting from the data.
Additional Style Details:
Include ample spacing (padding and margins) around data points to avoid clutter.
Ensure that any additional elements (like icons or labels) complement the overall modern look.
Consider accessibility best practices by using legible fonts and color contrasts.
Deliverable:
Provide a static HTML/CSS design mockup (with placeholder values for the data) that showcases the widget's look and feel. The focus should be entirely on the design aspects rather than on data fetching or dynamic updates.
